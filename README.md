# sorting_dart #

Currently contains only one file with the sorting algorithm. This was 
primarily a personal project to learn about the algorithms and see some
information on how they performed relative to each other. This was also
an exercise to then apply that knowledge to the dart language.

The samples included are not optimzied. They are memory hungry and
potentially resource hungry. These samples were written as proof of
concept and not for performance or with other constraints in mind.
